# How to host:
Run as a docker container (docker pull ghcr.io/wgrav01/memevotebot:nightly) with a persistant disk and an environment variable titled "TOKEN", if you have any errors relating to running out of threads set up a cron job to autuomatically restart the bot every hour if possible, and open an issue.
